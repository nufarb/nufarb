### Hi there, welcome to my Github page ðŸ‘‹

#### About me:
My name is Nufar (yes, yes with u) Braunstein, I'm 28 years old. I grew up in moshav 'Idan' in the Arava and today I live in Rehovot. I have B.Sc in biomedical engineering from Tel Aviv university.

---

During my degree I discovered programming, learning different languages and writing code, which sparked my interest in finding a job that will allow me to develop my skills in this field.

Therefor I'm looking for a job as a backend developer, I have no experience but I'm eager to learn and to work hard.
I know python and matlab but open to learn new languages.

I am a very responsible, diligent and proactive person with good management skills. I am autodidact and a "team player". I am very loyal and dedicated to my workplace.
